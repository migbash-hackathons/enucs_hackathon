This is a Hackathon Project for Data Analysis
---

This project came as a result of a team effort to visualize data (in JSON and CSV format) to "pretty visualize" it on a website. The data was supplied by the ENUCS committee members, obtained from Kaggle.

You can find a live version of the hackathon project [**here**](https://migbash-hackathons.github.io/enucs_hackathon/) or via the direct link below:

How it works?
---

Navigate to the live-version of the wesbite [**here**](https://migbash-hackathons.github.io/enucs_hackathon/).

**Graphs Section**

- Select from the ```Graphs``` Section, data that you wish to select for analysis and visualization, ie:

- Then, navigate to the bottom of the ```Graphs``` section and select an ```X-Axis Value```, ie:

- And a graph should now be visible, like this:

- You can now play around with the ```X-Axis Values``` and ```Select the Chart Type```, as well as ```Print and/or Export``` the chart as an image.

**Table Section**

- Navigate to the *Table Section*, located just below the *Graphs Section*.

- Similarly as with the *Graphs Section*, select the data that you wish to analyze and target for visualization, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20924663/90697416-a4fca980-e27e-11ea-8246-2e2df2532651.png)

- A **Table** should now appear before your eyes, like this:

- Now you can perform **live searches** on the data tables selected, ie:

For this project we have used:

- ```html5, css3, js``` for builing up the website,
- ```canvas.js``` used to display, manage and parse the data in JSON format,
- ```bootstrap v4.0.0``` used as a quicker library to get up and running,

Project Structure
---

- ```css/``` contains the main ```style``` file, as well as ```bootstrap v4.0.0-beta.min.css, owl-carousel.min.css``` and ```themify-icons.css```.
- ```data/``` contains all of the ```.json``` files used in this porject to make it work.
- ```fonts/``` contains the fonts used in this project website used locally, instead of being imported as a CDN tag,
